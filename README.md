# Enhance Low Resolution Image using GANs

The project involves implementation of ESRGAN using PyTorch to enhance low resolution images having a lot of loss in details to images having great spatial resolution. If time permits , we shall build a basic web app to deploy the project . It will be extremely fun to learn about GANs and you shall gain a lot of insight on deep learning in general. One can check out https://youtu.be/WCAF3PNEc_c . Our project shall be on the same lines. You may also go through the Andrew NG course on CNN https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF. The research paper that we will largely be following https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219 .

# Prerequisites
Intermediate Python Skills and a lot of Enthusiasm to learn about Deep Learning and Neural Networks.

# Resources
## Week 0
### Aim
During Week 0, we will review Python programming and object-oriented programming concepts. This knowledge will prove valuable when developing models.

## Week 1
### Aim
Get Acquainted with neural networks and the math behind it. You need not understand every nitty-griity of it , but this shall be your building blocks of deep learning to develop the intuition.
### Important links
* [Introduction to Deep FeedForward Neural Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-deep-feedforward-neural-networks-1af281e306cd)

* [Building neural networks from scratch in Python](https://medium.com/hackernoon/building-a-feedforward-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d3526457156b) Go through how neural networks were implemented long before libraries existed. Please code it side by side on your own too.


## Week 2
### Aim
The aim of this week is to get acquainted with PyTorch and develop an understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
### Important Links
* [PyTorch For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4) (Tutorials 1-14) <br/>

### Assignment
For this week's assignment, we would like you to implement a basic classification model utilizing Logistic Regression on the iris dataset in PyTorch. Also , please code side by side on your notebooks parallely while going through the PyTorch tutorials.
* [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) , you can refer [numpy implementation](https://medium.com/@kgpvijaybg/logistic-regression-on-iris-dataset-48b2ecdfb6d3) to get an idea.

## Week 3
### Aim
We will keep this week's learnings on the lighter side so that you can catch up. The aim is to get familiar with the nn.Module of PyTorch.
### Important Links
* [nn.Module Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html)
* [Implementation of a CNN based Image Classifier using PyTorch](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-of-a-cnn-based-image-classifier-using-pytorch)
### Assignment
In this week's assignment , you will be applying a classification CNN using PyTorch to recognize digits on the MNIST dataset. One can refer to [CNN with MNIST](https://medium.com/@nutanbhogendrasharma/pytorch-convolutional-neural-network-with-mnist-dataset-4e8a4265e118) but should not copy from the same.

## Week 4
### Aim
We won't give any coding assignments for this week , there's some reading material that we would like you to go through 
### Important links
* [Introduction to GANs](https://learnopencv.com/introduction-to-generative-adversarial-networks/)
* [Implementing with PyTorch](https://www.run.ai/guides/deep-learning-for-computer-vision/pytorch-gan)
